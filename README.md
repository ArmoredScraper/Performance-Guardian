# Performance-Guardian
I was motivated last week to make an app to always have up that monitors my cpu, i/o, memory....And wifi. Now, whenever I make and run things on my computer, I can monitor what its using in live time so I can terminate it before it freezes my computer.
So I wrote yesterday about feeling the code. But when I woke up this morning, I realized I'd make myself more valuable if I did my drills, studied, and leverage AI to build things. I spent quiet a while making this today and I'm dead tired so I'll just post  the files for the code tomorrow so people can download it and adjust it to their need.
